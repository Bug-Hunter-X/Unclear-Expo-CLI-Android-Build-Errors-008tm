The solution focuses on systematic troubleshooting:

1. **Clean the project:**
   ```bash
   expo start --clear
   ```
2. **Check dependencies:**
   Carefully review your `package.json` to ensure all dependencies are compatible.  Check for known issues with your dependencies by searching online.
3. **Verify Android setup:**
   * Ensure the Android SDK is installed and updated.
   * Check the Android build tools are correctly configured.
   * Test the Android emulator to ensure it is functioning correctly.
4. **Examine log files:**
   The complete build logs (usually located in a `.expo` directory) contain valuable information.  Analyze these logs thoroughly.
5. **Simplify the project:**
   Temporarily remove less essential modules or features from your project to help isolate the problem.  Try commenting out large parts of your code to see if a specific area is causing issues. 
6. **Update Expo CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
   Then try building the project again.
