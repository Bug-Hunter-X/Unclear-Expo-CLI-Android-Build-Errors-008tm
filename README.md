# Unclear Expo CLI Android Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Expo projects for Android. The problem is characterized by vague error messages during the build process, making debugging difficult.  The example provided shows a typical project setup, and the solution focuses on systematic troubleshooting techniques to pinpoint the problem.

## Problem

The Expo CLI build process unexpectedly fails without providing clear error messages to guide debugging.  This can stem from various underlying problems, including:

* Dependency conflicts
* Incorrect Android environment setup
* Problems with the Android SDK or build tools
* Issues in the project configuration

## Solution

The solution involves a methodical approach:

1. **Clean the project:** This involves removing the build cache and restarting the build process. 
2. **Check dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible and correctly installed.
3. **Verify Android setup:** Confirm the Android SDK, build tools, and emulator are properly configured and updated.
4. **Examine log files:** Carefully review the complete build logs for any clues, even seemingly unrelated messages.
5. **Simplify the project:** Try removing unnecessary modules or features to isolate the problem.
6. **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure to use the latest version of the Expo CLI and SDK.

This repository offers a basic example project, demonstrating the issue and illustrating the steps of the solution.
